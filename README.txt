Hello Lecturers of TUDublin!

This is Dovydas Rybakas, B00108417 from Blanchardstown Campus.

I'd like to include this message on how to correctly execute the steps in case some parts of code are not working.

===========================
Keylogger Detector
===========================
If the keylogger detector must be run through PyCharm to correctly execute it.
If you receive errors such as "missing pynput" a package must be installed.
Go to File > Settings > Python Interpreter > + > And search for the missing element.


===========================
C++ Keylogger Detector
===========================
If in a case C++ keylogger does not execute, please install Visual Studios which will give the application the missing elements.

===========================
Dropbox Upload (XboxSender)
===========================

This will code will most likely not execute due to the expired API key.
To get your own, register or Dropbox as a developer and generate your key in the Admin Console.
Keep in mind, it expires every 4 hours.

===========================
Testing Vulnerable Microsoft Defender
===========================

You can do this with either one, but I would recommend trying this with Python keylogger.

Convert the Python keylogger script using Pyinstaller "pyinstaller --onefile [location/of/file][filename].py"
Then put it on a new Windows 11 system to showcase the keylogger bypassing Virus & Threat Protection.
If it is getting detected, you can try it with the oldest version of the, the ISO is included in the Bibliography with a link in case Microsoft have updated their Win 11 ISO.
